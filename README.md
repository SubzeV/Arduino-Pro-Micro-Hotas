# About the project

## A short explainer
This project consist of 3D models that are all made for 3D printing, and some arduino code for an Arduino Pro Micro/similar HID capable arduino devices.
The joystick is by far the most complicated one and requires rubber bands or springs for centering.

The goal is to make an affordable joystick and throttle setup (if you already have a 3D printer & some leftover filament that is)

This project is still in development so expect big changes to happen every so often.

## The joystick mechanism
The joystick consists of many modular parts.

(Please note that not all required M4 screws and nuts might be visible in this image)

## The throttle mechanism
This part is still a W.I.P. and documentation will be updated once ready
